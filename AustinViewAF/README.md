# Project Objective
  this project is using Angular Cli and Google Firebase as an database storage. this WebApp is still very primitive, but it cantains a great potential opportunity of expanding its features.

# what is AustinView?
  This is a website which showes Austin residents or tourists from all over the world where they should go, and what they should do in Austin area. Each location in this website shows a description, a youtube, and a google Map of that location.
  
# What have been done on this WebApp?
- At this stage, we can only view a few locations mostly scenery.
- we can add more location, and it will be save on firebase.
# Problems:
 1. we must enter placeID manually (must count the number of locations which had already been in the list and enter the next number 
for placeID, ex: if there are 4 loactions, then we must enter 5 for placeID) But i will fix this problem ASAP.
solved: now the placeID will increase by 1 after each uploading.

2. will disable entering placeID, do it next.

# what is next?
- Add famous caffee shops, famous restaurants, and many more.
- Authentication would be an option.
